Project Overview: Solving Business Problems with Optimization Techniques
Objective:
This project addresses a real-world business problem using optimization techniques such as Linear Programming, implemented in Python with the PuLP library. The goal is to optimize decision-making in resource allocation to achieve maximum profitability under given constraints.

Key Features:
Problem Setup:

Objective Function: Define and maximize/minimize a target metric (e.g., profit, cost, or efficiency).
Decision Variables: Represent the quantities or actions to be optimized (e.g., production units, resource allocation).
Constraints: Real-world limitations like resource availability, budget, labor hours, or market demand.
Solution Implementation:

Formulate the problem mathematically using PuLP.
Solve the optimization model to determine the optimal decision variables that meet the constraints.
Insights and Analysis:

Generate insights into the resource utilization and bottlenecks.
Conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in constraints or parameters impact the optimal solution.
Visualization:

Use graphical methods to illustrate the feasible region, constraint boundaries, and the optimal solution.
Plot insights such as resource usage and shadow prices for better interpretation.
Deliverable:

A Jupyter Notebook showcasing:
Problem formulation and mathematical model.
Step-by-step solution using Python code.
Key insights and business recommendations.
Tools and Technologies:
Python Libraries:
PuLP: Linear programming solver.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization tools for insights.
Pandas: Data analysis and reporting.
Optimization Technique: Linear Programming.
Business Value:
The deliverable provides a practical approach to solving business problems through optimization. It enables data-driven decision-making, enhancing resource efficiency and profitability while offering actionable insights into operational constraints.

This project is suitable for applications in supply chain management, production planning, workforce optimization, and financial portfolio allocation.
